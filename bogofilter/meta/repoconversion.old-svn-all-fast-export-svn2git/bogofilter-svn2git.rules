# Subversion doesn't understand the Git concept of tags
# In Subversion, tags are really branches

# Only a post-processing (i.e., after converting to Git) of the tag
# branches can we be sure that a tag wasn't moved or changed from the
# branch it was copied from
#
# So we don't pretend that SVN tags are Git tags and then import
# everything as one
