This is a loose collection of texts, scripts, configuration files,
to record a reproducible SVN-to-Git conversion of the bogofilter
repository.

As of 2016-09-30, it is a work in progress that does not yet yield a
fully usable repository nor one that would be in a shape that reflected
in Git terms what our sub-"branches" such as vendor branches or relesae
branches were about, or where tags for past releases were believed to be
correct.  The tool set was on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS.

- Conversion tool:
  https://github.com/svn-all-fast-export/svn2git.git
  as of commit 437beb49 (late August 2016), with Git 2.7.

- TODO:
  * check if tagged branches and simple tags are properly converted (to
    heavyweight tags)
  * can we figure out what SVN revision a particular release was made
    from? It would be good if for releases at least since 1.0.0, the
    tags were known to be correct.
  * what do we do with vendor imports? subtrees? submodules? leave as
    is? branches - while useful in SVN - are not a useful mapping in
    Git.
  * what to do with the website? Separate project? subtree? submodule?
- NOTE:
  * submodules appear to have some drawbacks
